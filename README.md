Information on whether or not an amino acid peptide exhibited antibody-inducing activity (marked by an activity label) could be obtained from IEDB, which was used in many previous studies. Accordingly, this information was used as the label data. We also obtained the epitope candidate amino acid sequences (peptides) and the activity label data from the B-cell epitope data provided in IEDB. The presented antibody proteins were restricted to IgG that constituted the most recorded type in IEDB. For convenience, we excluded records representing different quantitative measures of antibody activity for the same peptide from experiments. The epitope data obtained from IEDB corresponded to the five types of activity: "Positive-High," "Positive-Intermediate," "Positive-Low," "Positive," and "Negative." However, due to the limited number of data elements marked with the "Positive-High," "Positive-Intermediate," and "Positive-Low" labels, we equally considered these labels as "Positive", thereby attributing the task to a binary estimation.
